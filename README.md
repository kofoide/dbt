# dbt on PostgreSQL

This project uses the [dvdrental sample database](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-getting-started/postgresql-sample-database/)

Because PostgreSQL does not allow cross database queries, everything is done in a database named warehouse

The dvdrental source data is in, wait for it, a schema named dvdrental
